        Hi! I’m Neha Satish, a senior majoring in Computer Science at the University of Michigan’s College of Engineering. I’ve previously worked in the automotive and biomedical devices industries, where I honed my product data analysis, statistical research, and entrepreneurship skills. <br />
        <br />
        At Ford, I developed an internal web application that reduced the data ingestion timeline for product feedback by a week. I’m still a part of the Ford Fund program, where I lead a campaign against common issues faced by young children around the world. 

        At Warmilu, a non-electric infant warming technology company, I was tasked with data analysis for their medical trials as well as outreach. Through this, I and one other intern were able to increase our company’s partners from 15 countries to over 70 in two months. As a result, many infant deaths from hypothermia and hypothermia-related causes were prevented.<br />
        <br />
       I have been accepted to do Computer Science Engineering research at the University of Michigan on the applications of fluid computing. I’m also in MRACING, the #1 Formula SAE team in the U.S., where we build Formula cars and race them in international competitions.<br />
        <br />
       BOLD is about elevating those who are underrepresented which is a value that I resonate with. If I were to get this opportunity, it would aid in using engineering to improve the lives of the neediest through low-cost, effective, and scalable solutions.
